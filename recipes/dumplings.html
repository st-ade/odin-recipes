    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed.</p>
    <p>These dumplings are prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew (this was my dinner on the day I completed this project!)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or margarine</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.</li>
