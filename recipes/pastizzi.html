    <h2 class="header2">Description</h2>
    <p class="bodymain">Pastizzi can be filled with either ricotta or curry peas and they are the number one Maltese snack food!</p>
    <h2 class="header2">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="bodymain list">
            <li class="list-content">Make the dough by putting the dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the oil and water and let it knead for about 12 mins until you have a nice smooth dough. Let it rest for about half an hour. Cut the dough in half. Open one of the halves into a long strip.</li>
            <li class="list-content">Take both fats and mix them together. Divide in two. Take one part of the mixed fat and slather it all over the rolled out dough.</li>
            <li class="list-content">From the end closest to you, start stretching and rolling while widening the dough as shown. Keep doing this until you reach the other end. You'll end up with a long rope like piece of dough.</li>
            <li class="list-content">Take one end and roll it into a spiral shape. Put some fat over the top, cover and store in the fridge until ready to use. Do the same with the other piece of dough and remaining fat.</li>
            <li class="list-content">Make the pastizzi filling by mixing 1lb ricotta, 2 eggs and pinch of salt together.</li>
            <li class="list-content">Take the end of the spiral shaped dough and cut about two inches off the end. Flatten it with your hand as you turn it round and round between your fingers so you can see the ridges of the dough forming. Form it into a circle about 3-4 inches in diameter. Put a dollop of ricotta in the middle.</li>
            <li class="list-content">Fold over and seal and place on a greased dish or on a silpat. Do this until you've used up all the dough and ricotta.</li>
            <li class="list-content">Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 20-30 mins until golden brown.</li>
